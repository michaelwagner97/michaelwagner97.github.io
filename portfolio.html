  <p1>  Project 1: Helping a Non-Profit. 
  One of my most impactful assignments was helping a non-profit organization called "Nuestros Cuentos." Nuestros Cuentos helps young Latin-American students come together to share their stories.
  They share stories of traditions, family, their culture, and more. In my intro to professional writing class, we helped to design informational handouts 
  for the families and teachers involved in the program. Most of my work on the project involved deciding what information was most relevant to each recipient (parent/teacher). 
  We presented our project after completion, and the client was thrilled to have the support of our class.
