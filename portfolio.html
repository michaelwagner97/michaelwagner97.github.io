     <h2><b>Internship: Blue Sky Productions</b></h2> 
  </header2>
  <br></br>
  <p1>Over the summer of 2017, I interned with renowned automotive journalist and analyst John McElroy at his company, Blue Sky Productions. The internship helped me along the path to my ultimate career goal as a professional writer in the automotive industry. 
    Tasks given to me included writing stories for their daily show, Autoline Daily, and field research at automotive press events. One example of a such an event was the Fiat Chrysler Automobile "What's New?" event at their proving grounds in Chelsea, MI. I interviewed
    engineers, PR representatives, and others to gain information on their newest cars. I also drove the cars and learned how to judge a car and review it. Another task I was given was transcribing audio during interviews with guests, and creating soundbites to use in 
    shows and articles.
